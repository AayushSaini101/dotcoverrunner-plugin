        Semicolon-separated list of process names. These processes will be disregarded in the test execution when
        DotCover is gathering coverage data. This can be helpful in scenarios where it is necessary to strictly define
        the scope of executables that are part of a test. For instance, DotCover sometimes (mistakenly) detects a
        database server as part of the the code being exercised in the test run, which can case problems with the
        coverage data because it tries to include the DB server in the scope of the test.
